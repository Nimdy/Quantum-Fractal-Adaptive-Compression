# Quantum Compression with Quantum and Classical Machine Learning

This project demonstrates advanced quantum compression techniques using quantum and classical machine learning. It incorporates Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs), Quantum Autoencoders, hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, and noise mitigation strategies to provide a cutting-edge solution for data compression.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Virtual environment tools (optional but recommended)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/quantum-compression.git
   cd quantum-compression
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**

   It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Main Script**

   To perform quantum compression and evaluate the results, run the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will execute the complete workflow, including data generation, quantum and classical compression, and model training.

2. **Understanding the Output**

   - **Optimal Parameters for Quantum Compression**: Outputs the optimal parameters found by the VQE algorithm.
   - **Quantum Compression Results with Noise Mitigation**: Prints the result of the quantum circuit simulation.
   - **Accuracy without Compression**: Shows the accuracy of the logistic regression model on the uncompressed data.
   - **Predicted Compressibility**: Displays the neural network's prediction for data compressibility.
   - **Quantum Autoencoder Compression Results**: Prints the result of the quantum autoencoder compression.

## Testing

To verify the functionality of the quantum compression project, follow these steps:

1. **Unit Tests**

   Ensure you have the `pytest` framework installed:

   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```

   Run the unit tests:

   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

   This will run all test cases in the `tests` directory and provide a summary of the results.

2. **Interactive Testing**

   For interactive testing and exploration, consider using Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Open the `quantum_compression.ipynb` notebook and execute the cells to interactively test and visualize the results.
